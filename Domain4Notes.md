# OSI Model
**All People Seem To Need Data Processing**

- 7: Application:  HTTP, FTP, Telnet
- 6:  Presentation:  ASCII, Jpg, GIF, Midi
- 5:  Session:  NFS, SQL, RPC, Simplex, Duplex, 
- 4:  Transport:  TCP, UDP, SPX, SSL/TLS
- 3:  Network:  ICMP, RIP, IP, IPSec, NAT, Border Gateway Protocol
- 2:  Data Link:  PPP, ARP, l2f, L2TP, ISDN
- 1:  Physical:  EIA/TIA 232 and 449, X.21, .v25

## Attack vectors
- Layer 1:  passive sniffing, electrical interference, cutting wire, 
- Layer 2:  ARP Spoofing/MAC Address forging
- Layer 3:  Man-in-the-Middle Attacks, Spoofing or Forging IP addresses, Denial of Service Attacks
- Layer 4:  SYN Flood, Session hijacking
- Layer 5:  Depreciated SSL protocol, less secure versions of TLS, attacks on NETBIOS and NFS
- Layer 6:  Attacks on the encryption schemes themselves.
- Layer 7:  **Most Security breaches happen here**, Hitting weaknesss in protocols (HTTP, FTP, SMTP, SNMP), SQL Injections, 

## TCP/IP Model
- Application:  DNS, DHCP, SMTP, POP/IMAP, X-Windows
- Transport:  TCP, UDP
- Internet:  IP, ARP, IGMP, ICMP
- Link:  Ethernet

RFC 2828 defines IKE as an Internet, IPSec, key establishing protocol that is intended for putting in place authentication keying material for use with ISAKMP
