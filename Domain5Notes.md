### How do you Define Security?
- use the security Triad (CIA)
- when you use it you can define

User/Subject and Resources/Object:  Subjects access an object

Subject -> Reference Monitor -> Object (The reference monitor will deny access by default)

Don't just consider technical security/logical security

### Access Control Services:
- Authorization
- Audit
- Accountability
- Identification

1. ID entity attempting access
2. Verify ID
3. Evaluate Rules
4. Log each access attempt
5. Review Logs
