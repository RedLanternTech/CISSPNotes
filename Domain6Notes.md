Security Assessment and Testing

Need to test administrative and technical (logical) controls

Need to make sure it covers everything
- Management commitment
- Policy
- Administrative Controls
- technical

It cannot disturb the production environment

**Always have a plan for when doing testing**

May not test everything but identify systems that are critical

Always maintain the CIA Principal

Do not have a technical report.  Always translate reports to discuss risk

Method for creating the report
1. Collect Data
2. Store the data
3. Organize the Data
4. Analyze the data
5. Report on the data
6. Rank and define your vulnerabilities

Perform a Security Assessment when
- you first deploy new systems
- when new vulnerabilities are identified
- a security breach occurs
- routinely 

Fine-tune reports for Management.  
 - Nessus is a tool that can be used for vulnerability assessment
 - OWASP Zap for Web applications

There are a variety of tools that do vulnerability scanning
- **don't use dark web tools at a professional level**
- Always use Professional tools

Penetration Testing
- simulates an attack
- less common but more intensive
- difference between a penetration test and a real attack is intent
- You must have a clearly defined scope before doing a penetration test

Reports from a Penetration Test Should include
- steps undertaken
- weaknesses identified
- recommendations

Penetration Testing Steps
1. Recon
2. Scanning
3. Exploitation
4. Maintaining Access 
5. Reporting

Types of Tests:
- Black Box:  you have no information about the target, most effective
- White Box:  you have all the information about the target
- Grey Box:  Balance between the two
