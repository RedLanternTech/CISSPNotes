Security Assessment and Testing

Need to test administrative and technical (logical) controls

Need to make sure it covers everything
- Management commitment
- Policy
- Administrative Controls
- technical

It cannot disturb the production environment

**Always have a plan for when doing testing**

May not test everything but identify systems that are critical

Always maintain the CIA Principal

Do not have a technical report.  Always translate reports to discuss risk

Method for creating the report
1. Collect Data
2. Store the data
3. Organize the Data
4. Analyze the data
5. Report on the data
6. Rank and define your vulnerabilities

Perform a Security Assessment when
- you first deploy new systems
- when new vulnerabilities are identified
- a security breach occurs
- routinely
