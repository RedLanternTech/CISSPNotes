Security Operations
- Maintain operational resilience
- protect valuable assets
- effective security services management

Least Privilege 
- give the user exactly what they need to do the job, no more
- cannot set and forget privileges, must alway be followed up and audited
 
 Separation of Duties
 - take two people to do a task.  Think launching nuclear missiles

Job Rotation/Tour of Duty Jobs
- avoids abuse of privileges
- cross-trains people to do a job so one person doesn't know it
- Mandatory vacations also apply here

## Software Development Methods
### Waterfall
- Sequential
- Define -> ->Estimating -> Creating -> Testing -> Operation
- When you complete a phase, you start the next one
- you don't go back
- When you finish a phase you don't go back

### Sashimi
- Runs in parallel
- All phases run in parallel
- Effective but security becomes a concern
