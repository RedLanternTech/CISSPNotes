Security Operations
- Maintain operational resilience
- protect valuable assets
- effective security services management

Least Privilege 
- give the user exactly what they need to do the job, no more
- cannot set and forget privileges, must alway be followed up and audited
 
 Separation of Duties
 - take two people to do a task.  Think launching nuclear missiles

Job Rotation/Tour of Duty Jobs
- avoids abuse of privileges
- cross-trains people to do a job so one person doesn't know it
- Mandatory vacations also apply here
