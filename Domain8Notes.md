0. Project Initiation
1. System Concept
2. Planning
3. Requiring Analysis
4. System Design
5. Software Development
6. Integration and Testing
7. Implementation 
8. Operational/Maintenance
9. Disposal

Two Types of Software Design Concepts- Proprietary and Open Source

Types of Disclosure:  Full or Partial

## Software Development Methods
### Waterfall
- Sequential
- Define -> ->Estimating -> Creating -> Testing -> Operation
- When you complete a phase, you start the next one
- you don't go back
- When you finish a phase you don't go back

### Sashimi
- Runs in parallel
- All phases run in parallel
- Effective but security becomes a concern

Spiral
- PLan
- Do
- Check
- Act
- This is a quality model
- it is a continuous process

Clean Room
- prevents changes
- Needs more time at the beginning to reduce change

Prototyping
- making samples

Agile
- project management model
- customer is involved in the process

Case or Computer Aid Software Engineering
- software helps develop the software

Change Control 
- need to have a proper change request
- request change
- approval
- communicating the change
- documenting the change 
- test and repeat
- implement the change
- report the change

When it comes to web forms (or any type of input), **Always Validate The Input**
- this is true to prevent SQL injection attacks on web forms

Integrity of data in software is needed
- database integrity
- entity integrity
- referential integrity
