## Software Development Methods
### Waterfall
- Sequential
- Define -> ->Estimating -> Creating -> Testing -> Operation
- When you complete a phase, you start the next one
- you don't go back
- When you finish a phase you don't go back

### Sashimi
- Runs in parallel
- All phases run in parallel
- Effective but security becomes a concern
