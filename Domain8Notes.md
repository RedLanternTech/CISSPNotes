### System Life Cycle
0. Project Initiation
1. System Concept
2. Planning
3. Requiring Analysis
4. System Design
5. Software Development
6. Integration and Testing
7. Implementation 
8. Operational/Maintenance
9. Disposal

Two Types of Software Design Concepts- Proprietary and Open Source

Types of Disclosure:  Full or Partial

## Software Development Methods
### Waterfall
- Sequential
- Define -> ->Estimating -> Creating -> Testing -> Operation
- When you complete a phase, you start the next one
- you don't go back
- When you finish a phase you don't go back
- This has fallen out of favor in many organizations.  Upside is it has strict control of the process.  

### Sashimi
- Runs in parallel
- All phases run in parallel
- Effective but security becomes a concern

Spiral
- PLan
- Do
- Check
- Act
- This is a quality model
- it is a continuous process

Clean Room
- prevents changes
- Needs more time at the beginning to reduce change

Prototyping
- making samples

Agile
- project management model
- customer is involved in the process
- 12 principles that make it up. 
- not a methodology but a set of ideas.  
- Highest priority is to satisfy the customer though early and continuous deliver.  Get them something useful early in development.  
- Majority of software development is being done this way 
- each iteration has a lesson's learned component. 

Case or Computer Aid Software Engineering
- software helps develop the software

Change Control 
- need to have a proper change request
- request change
- approval
- communicating the change
- documenting the change 
- test and repeat
- implement the change
- report the change

When it comes to web forms (or any type of input), **Always Validate The Input**
- this is true to prevent SQL injection attacks on web forms

Integrity of data in software is needed
- database integrity
- entity integrity
- referential integrity

## FR Secure Start 

- Initiation 
- Development 
- Deployment and Delivery 
- Operations and maintenance 
- Disposal

## DevOps - is the result of siloes.  
- keeps different departments from killing each other. 
- Combine Development and Operations 
- still respects separation of duties, but Development and Operations works together 
- quality is built in and we are all playing for the same team 
- All three groups work together.  

- have a lot of controls around devops.  Important to have good logging and access control.
- will need additional security controls 
- make sure you are enforcing least privlige and separation of duties.  Temporal permissins is important 

## DevSecOps 
- gets security involved 
- Leaning in - over always saying "no".  Be the department of how 
- Use data security science over fear 
- Open contribution & collaboration over security requiements 
- consumable security services with APIs over Mandated Security Control & Paperwork 
- Business Driven Security scores over Rubber stamp security 
- Red & Blue Team Exploit Testing 
- 24/7 Proactive Security Monitoring 
- Shared threat Intelligence 
- Compliance Operations 
- Iteration over Perfection 

- The CISSP will be in the Red Team 

## Maturity Models 
- CMM is the most common.  Use the best practice across successful projects .
- matured into the CMMI run by ISACA 
- initial
- Managed
- Defined
- Quantitatively managed
- Optimizing

### SAMM 
- baking security proccess into an existing SDLC 

- The Theme:  What are we going to do, what is the plan, what are we designing, how do we make it, how do we get it into an operational state 

Change control will trigger a review for potential security impacts
