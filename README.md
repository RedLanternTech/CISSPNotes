# Notes for the CISSP Exam

These are my personal notes for my cissp study.  Hopefully they can help anyone who reads this

I'm also using this to test out github, learn markdown, and VI controls.  Lets see how that works :-)

I am basically retyping my notes and keeping them all in Markdown docs.  One doc for each domain.  If the spelling looks horrible, sorry 

Update April 2022:  I've also started attending the FRSecure study group/classes which so far has had great discussion.  [Register Here](https://frsecure.com/cissp-mentor-program/)

Update August 2022:  As of August 5th 2022, I have provisionally passed the CISSP exam.  These notes played a big part in it.  Hopefully the can help others.
